# Contributing to our project
We are very glad that you are interested in how exactly you can help our project

## How can I contribute?
### Suggest a preset or a tool that you would like to see

Perhaps you have your own usage of this tool, and you are tired of repeating a lot of actions in the configurator. However, we **WANT** to add more useful tools and presets, and we will be very glad to see your suggestion in the [issues section](https://github.com/Lunar-Creators/FFpepeg/issues)

### Let us know about the bugs

Finding bugs is also a very good contribution to the project, this is how we will be able to maintain the stability of our collection of tools together.

### If you understand how the script works and want to suggest how to improve the code

Another kind of how you can contribute to our project. Perhaps this is even the largest type of contribution, as it can completely turn around and improve the development.

You can learn more about how our code works in our [wiki](https://github.com/Lunar-Creators/FFpepeg/wiki)

## [Support the project with money](https://www.donationalerts.com/r/shulker_play)

We will be glad of any support, but still the contribution of finding bugs and offering new features will push the development further.
